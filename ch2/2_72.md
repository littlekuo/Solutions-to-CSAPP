## A
sizeof(val) return type size_t, it usually is a kind of unsigned type.
calculate maxbytes - sizeof(val) will also get a value of unsigned type , it is always >= 0

## B

```c

void copy_int(int val, void* buf, int maxbytes) {

  if (maxbytes >= (int) sizeof(val)) {
    memcpy(buf, (void*)&val, sizeof(val));
  }

}

```
